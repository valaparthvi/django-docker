Integration of Django with Docker


We are making a tool that will provide an easy integration for Django with Docker.
This tool will perform operation similar to ```docker build```, but specifically for the django project with the use of a command similar to ```python manage.py docker build```, along with other required arguments, and build the corresponding Docker image for your Django project.

Code in Progress...
